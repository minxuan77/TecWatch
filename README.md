# Non-html elements (Cass)
This branch manages non-frontend elements like testing cases via Selenium. Below are some additions and modifications made. 

## Currently in progress: additional testing cases for tenants in tests.py
- Login testing works for tenant
- Some issues testing tenant navigation + form upload pages due to liveserver not taking our existing backend.
