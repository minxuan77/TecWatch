# Branch for frontend management (Cass)
Scrapping React frontend in favour of a more integrable direct HTML/CSS/JS setup with Django. Old React webpage will be left in cass-testing-branch for future references

## Currently working on:
- Managing layouts by packaging HTML elements to reusable CSS files (TBC).
- Testing usage of JS files.
- Implementation of grid methods where possible to ease testing
